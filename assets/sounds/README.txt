If you want to extend the pitch range of a sound put two files named "<sound>Low.wav" and "<sound>High.wav" (replace <sound> with the name of the base game sound) into this folder

The Low pitched sound file should contain the base sound pitched to C4, the high pitched sound file should be pitched to C8.
This will give you a total pitch range from C3-C9.
For optimal results the pitched versions should be sped up/slowed down versions of the base sound.

As an example if you wanted more pitches for your cat Piano (using the cat sound), then there should be two files in here named "catLow.wav" and "catHigh.wav".
